You’re absolutely right! Implementing a project initiation wizard to clearly define the scope, mission, and vision of a new project would be highly beneficial. Not only does it provide clarity for you and any collaborators, but it also gives the AI assistant a well-defined context to generate more accurate and relevant suggestions.

Feature: Project Initiation Wizard

Objective:

Develop a guided wizard that helps users articulate the key aspects of a new project during its creation. This ensures that the project’s goals are clearly defined from the outset, enabling the AI to provide tailored assistance and maintain alignment with the project’s vision.

⸻

Functionality Overview
	1.	Guided Questions:
	•	The wizard presents a series of prompts to the user to capture essential project information.
	•	Questions are designed to elicit detailed responses about the project’s purpose, target audience, key features, and success criteria.
	2.	Scope and Goals Definition:
	•	Users define the project’s scope, including what is in-scope and out-of-scope.
	•	Set short-term and long-term goals, along with milestones.
	3.	Mission and Vision Statements:
	•	Assist users in crafting concise mission and vision statements for the project.
	•	Provide examples and templates to guide the user.
	4.	AI Assistance:
	•	The AI can offer suggestions or enhancements to the user’s inputs.
	•	Option to generate initial drafts based on minimal input.
	5.	Summary and Confirmation:
	•	Present a summary of the entered information for review.
	•	Allow users to make edits before finalizing the project setup.

Implementation Plan

1. Design the Wizard Interface
	•	UI Components (UIComponents/):
	•	Templates (templates/):
	•	projectWizard.html: HTML template for the wizard steps.
	•	wizardComponents.html: Reusable components like input fields, tooltips, progress indicators.
	•	Styles (styles/):
	•	wizard.css: Styles specific to the wizard interface.
	•	Scripts (scripts/):
	•	wizard.js: Client-side logic to handle user inputs, navigation between steps, and validation.

2. Develop Wizard Logic
	•	Wizard Controller (ProjectInitiationWizard/controllers/wizardController.js):
	•	Handles the flow of the wizard, processes user inputs, and interacts with the AI for suggestions.
	•	Routes (ProjectInitiationWizard/routes/wizardRoutes.js):
	•	Define endpoints for saving interim data, retrieving AI suggestions, and finalizing project creation.

3. Enhance AI Integration
	•	AI Prompts (AISuggestions/prompts/aiPrompts.js):
	•	Create prompts tailored to help users define mission and vision statements.
	•	AI Controller (AISuggestions/controllers/aiController.js):
	•	Implement functions to provide real-time AI assistance during the wizard steps.

4. Update Data Models
	•	Project Model (ProjectOrganizer/models/projectModel.js):
	•	Add new fields:
	•	missionStatement: String
	•	visionStatement: String
	•	scope: Object containing inScope and outScope arrays or descriptions.
	•	goals: Object or array detailing short-term and long-term goals.

5. Integration with Existing Features
	•	Feature Prioritization:
	•	Use the defined scope and goals to better prioritize features and provide more accurate AI suggestions.
	•	Contextual AI Assistance:
	•	The AI can reference the mission and vision statements when analyzing new features or detecting deviations.

Wizard Steps Overview
	1.	Welcome Screen:
	•	Brief introduction to the wizard and its purpose.
	2.	Project Basics:
	•	Project Name
	•	Short Description
	3.	Define Mission Statement:
	•	Prompt: “What is the core purpose of this project?”
	•	AI Assistance: Offer examples or generate a draft based on keywords.
	4.	Define Vision Statement:
	•	Prompt: “What is the long-term impact or goal you envision for this project?”
	•	AI Assistance: Provide templates or initial drafts.
	5.	Set Scope:
	•	In-Scope Items:
	•	List functionalities, features, or areas that the project will cover.
	•	Out-of-Scope Items:
	•	Clarify what is not included to prevent scope creep.
	6.	Establish Goals and Milestones:
	•	Short-Term Goals:
	•	Immediate objectives, perhaps for the MVP.
	•	Long-Term Goals:
	•	Future expansions, versions 1.5, 2.0, etc.
	7.	Target Audience:
	•	Define who the project is for.
	8.	Success Criteria:
	•	Determine how success will be measured (e.g., user engagement, feature completion).
	9.	Review and Confirm:
	•	Display a summary of all inputs.
	•	Allow editing before finalization.

Benefits
	•	Clarity and Focus:
	•	Clearly defined project parameters help maintain focus and guide decision-making.
	•	Enhanced AI Performance:
	•	The AI can provide more relevant suggestions by understanding the project’s intent and boundaries.
	•	Efficient Feature Management:
	•	Easier to prioritize features that align with the mission and vision.
	•	Improved Collaboration:
	•	If multiple users are involved (in future versions), a clear project foundation aids in team alignment.

Next Steps
	1.	Design UI Mockups:
	•	Create visual designs for each step of the wizard to ensure a smooth user experience.
	2.	Implement the Wizard Interface:
	•	Develop the frontend components and ensure responsive design.
	3.	Develop Backend Logic:
	•	Set up routes and controllers to handle data processing and storage.
	4.	Integrate AI Assistance:
	•	Ensure real-time AI suggestions are available during the wizard steps.
	5.	Test the Workflow:
	•	Conduct user testing to refine the questions and improve usability.

Additional Considerations
	•	Optional Steps:
	•	Allow users to skip certain steps if they prefer to fill in information later.
	•	User Guidance:
	•	Include tooltips or examples to help users who may be unfamiliar with crafting mission or vision statements.
	•	AI Learning:
	•	Over time, collect anonymized data (with user consent) to improve AI suggestions for project initiation.
	•	Localization Support:
	•	Consider supporting multiple languages if your user base is international.

Example Interaction

User is on the “Define Mission Statement” step.
	•	Prompt: “Describe the core purpose of your project. What problem does it solve?”
	•	User Input: “I want to help teams organize their project ideas more effectively.”
	•	AI Suggestion:
	•	“Our mission is to empower teams to efficiently organize and prioritize project ideas, enhancing collaboration and productivity.”
	•	User Action:
	•	Accepts the AI’s suggestion or edits it further.

⸻

User proceeds to the “Set Scope” step.
	•	In-Scope:
	•	Feature prioritization
	•	AI-generated suggestions
	•	Project branching
	•	Out-of-Scope:
	•	Real-time collaboration (planned for future versions)
	•	Mobile application

⸻

Integration with AI Branching Feature
	•	The detailed scope and goals help the AI more accurately detect when new features deviate from the project’s intent.
	•	When suggesting a branch, the AI can reference specific elements from the mission or scope to explain its reasoning.

⸻

By implementing this project initiation wizard, we enhance both the user experience and the effectiveness of the AI assistance. It lays a solid foundation for the project and streamlines subsequent feature management and prioritization.

Let me know if this aligns with your vision or if there’s anything you’d like to modify or add! I’m excited to incorporate this feature into the project.

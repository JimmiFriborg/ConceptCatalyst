Functionality Overview
	1.	Cross-Project Feature Pool:
	•	Compile a pool of features from all projects owned by the user.
	•	Include both in-scope and out-of-scope features to maximize creativity.
	•	Allow users to filter features based on tags, categories, or projects.
	2.	Random Feature Selection:
	•	Implement a randomizer that selects a set number of features from the pool.
	•	Users can specify the number of features to include or set constraints (e.g., at least one UI/UX feature).
	3.	AI Wildcard Suggestions:
	•	The AI takes the selected features and generates new concept ideas that utilize them.
	•	Provide wildcard ideas that may not be immediately obvious, encouraging out-of-the-box thinking.
	4.	Interactive Mixing and Matching:
	•	Allow users to manually select and deselect features to include in the compilation.
	•	Provide an interface where users can see how different combinations affect the AI’s suggestions.
	5.	Concept Creation and Management:
	•	Users can save AI-generated concepts as new projects or features.
	•	Enable further development and refinement of these concepts within the app.
	6.	Collaboration and Sharing:
	•	(For future versions) Allow users to share their Frankenstein compilations with others.
	•	Encourage collaborative brainstorming sessions.

	•	Ensure that features in the Frankenstein compilation maintain references to their original projects.
	•	Allow users to view more details about each feature if needed.
	•	Concept Saving:
	•	Users can save AI-generated concepts as new features or projects.
	•	Provide options to edit and refine these concepts further.

7. User Experience Enhancements
	•	Engagement Elements:
	•	Use animations and visual effects when randomizing features to enhance user engagement.
	•	Gamify the experience by adding achievements or badges for creating compilations.
	•	Guidance and Tips:

Technical Considerations

AI Prompt Design
	•	Example Prompt Structure:

"Using the following features:

1. [Feature Title 1]: [Feature Description 1]
2. [Feature Title 2]: [Feature Description 2]
3. [Feature Title 3]: [Feature Description 3]

Generate innovative concept ideas that combine these features in creative ways. Provide wildcard suggestions that explore unconventional applications or markets."


	•	AI Model Selection:
	•	Use a model capable of creative idea generation (e.g., OpenAI’s GPT-4).
	•	Ensure prompts encourage divergent thinking.

Performance Optimization
	•	Asynchronous Processing:
	•	Handle AI requests asynchronously to prevent UI blocking.
	•	Implement loading indicators while AI suggestions are being generated.

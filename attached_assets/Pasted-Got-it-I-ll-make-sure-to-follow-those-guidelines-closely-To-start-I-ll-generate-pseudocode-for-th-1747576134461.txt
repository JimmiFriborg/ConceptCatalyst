Got it! I’ll make sure to follow those guidelines closely. To start, I’ll generate pseudocode for the initial project management and feature categorization functionalities. This will help us establish a clear structure before diving into implementation.

Pseudocode Overview

1. File Structure:
	•	app.js: Main server setup and routing.
	•	Purpose: Initialize the server, handle routing, and integrate middleware.
	•	models/: Database models for user, project, and features.
	•	user.js: Define user schema.
	•	project.js: Define project schema, which includes metadata like project title, description, etc.
	•	feature.js: Define feature schema, which contains cards with title, description, status, and AI suggestions.
	•	routes/: Handle requests for authentication, project, and feature management.
	•	auth.js: Routes for user authentication (login, signup).
	•	projectRoutes.js: Routes for creating, listing, and managing projects.
	•	featureRoutes.js: Routes for creating, updating, deleting, and sorting features.
	•	controllers/: Logic for managing requests.
	•	authController.js: Logic for user signup and login.
	•	projectController.js: Logic for handling project creation, retrieval, and updates.
	•	featureController.js: Logic for feature creation, categorization, and interaction with AI.
	•	public/: Static files such as CSS, JS, and images.
	•	styles.css: Basic styles for project overview and feature cards.
	•	views/: Frontend components using HTML and basic JavaScript.
	•	projectOverview.html: Displays a user’s projects in a grid.
	•	projectDetail.html: Displays project details, unsorted features, and categorized features.
	•	utils/: Utility functions.
	•	aiIntegration.js: Utility to handle interaction with OpenAI’s API.

2. Server Setup (app.js):

- Import necessary libraries (express, body-parser, database connection, etc.)
- Setup middleware (JSON parsing, CORS, etc.)
- Define routes for:
  - Authentication
  - Project management
  - Feature management
- Listen on a specified port

3. Models:
	•	User (user.js):
	•	Define a User schema with fields: username, email, password hash.
	•	Include a list of project IDs associated with the user.
	•	Project (project.js):
	•	Define a Project schema with fields: title, short description, created date, user reference.
	•	Include metadata like last AI analysis date, project status.
	•	Feature (feature.js):
	•	Define a Feature schema with fields: title, description, category (e.g., MVP, Launch, Rejected).
	•	Include fields for AI suggestions, PoV tags, rationale.

4. Authentication (auth.js and authController.js):

- Setup routes for:
  - Signup
    - Validate input fields (username, email, password)
    - Create new user in database
  - Login
    - Check email and password hash against records
    - Return success or failure status

5. Project Management (projectRoutes.js and projectController.js):

- Routes for:
  - Create new project
    - Validate input (title, description)
    - Create project linked to user ID
  - Get all projects for a user
    - Retrieve projects based on user ID
  - Update project details
    - Edit project title, description, status

6. Feature Management (featureRoutes.js and featureController.js):

- Routes for:
  - Add new feature to a project
    - Validate feature input
    - Link feature to project
  - Get all features of a project
    - Return unsorted and categorized features
  - Update feature status or category
    - Allow movement between categories (e.g., drag and drop)
  - Interact with AI for suggestions
    - Use utility (`aiIntegration.js`) to get new AI insights
    - Append suggestions to relevant feature card

7. Frontend (Views and Interaction):
	•	Project Overview (projectOverview.html):
	•	Display projects in a grid with relevant metadata.
	•	Include a button to quickly call AI analysis on a project level.
	•	Project Detail (projectDetail.html):
	•	Display project title, description, and AI quick actions.
	•	Show a deck of unsorted features with colored labels indicating the suggestion type.
	•	Separate sections for categorized features (e.g., MVP, Launch, Rejected).
	•	Allow drag-and-drop for sorting feature cards.
	•	Feature Cards (styles.css):
	•	Use consistent colors to indicate suggestion type (e.g., technical, business).
	•	Create drag-and-drop zones for categorized areas.

8. AI Integration (aiIntegration.js):

- Function to call OpenAI's API:
  - Accept project or feature details
  - Generate AI suggestions
  - Return AI response with suggested improvements or new features
- Include methods for different PoVs:
  - Technical, business, security, etc.
- Ensure API key and request formats are handled securely

Next Steps for Implementation:
	1.	Create the file structure based on this pseudocode.
	2.	Begin implementing the backend logic—starting with user authentication and database models for user, project, and features.
	3.	Design the frontend views to support card-based interaction, drag-and-drop sorting, and integration of AI quick actions.

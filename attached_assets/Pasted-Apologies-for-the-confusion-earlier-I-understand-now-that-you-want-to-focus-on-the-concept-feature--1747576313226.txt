Apologies for the confusion earlier. I understand now that you want to focus on the concept feature organizer/prioritizer project that you originally pitched. Let’s reorganize the project structure to reflect a feature-driven, domain-focused architecture, as you described.

Implementing Your Concept Feature Organizer/Prioritizer with This Structure
	1.	Focus on Core Features:
	•	ProjectOrganizer: Implement functionalities for users to create and manage multiple projects.
	•	FeatureManager: Allow users to input features with descriptions/rationales, categorize them, and adjust statuses.
	•	AISuggestions: Integrate AI capabilities to suggest new features, expand on descriptions, and analyze priorities.
	2.	User Interaction Workflow:
	•	Project Overview:
	•	Upon login, users see their projects in a grid format.
	•	Each project card displays relevant information and quick AI actions.
	•	Project Detail View:
	•	Displays project title, description, AI quick actions.
	•	Shows unsorted features and suggestions as a deck of cards.
	•	Provides drag-and-drop areas for different categories (MVP, Launch, Version 1.5, Rejected).
	•	Feature Cards:
	•	Each feature is a card containing title, description, tags, AI suggestions, and status.
	•	Users can prompt the AI for specific inputs directly from the feature card.
	3.	AI Integration:
	•	AISuggestions handles all AI interactions.
	•	Users can request AI to:
	•	Suggest new features.
	•	Expand on descriptions or rationales.
	•	Analyze and recommend priority categories based on input.
	•	The AI suggestions are clearly labeled with the point of view (e.g., technical, business, UI/UX).
	4.	Flexibility and Modifiability:
	•	Users can change the status, labels, and categories of features at any time.
	•	A “Rejected” category is available for features or suggestions that are not currently relevant but may be reconsidered later.
	5.	UI Components:
	•	Utilize the UIComponents folder to create reusable elements like feature cards, drag-and-drop areas, and AI interaction buttons.
	•	Ensure the interface is modern and intuitive, focusing on user experience.
	6.	Data Handling:
	•	Use DataModels to set up your database schemas for users, projects, features, and AI suggestions.
	•	Implement secure user authentication and data storage.

Benefits of This Structure
	•	Domain-Focused Organization: By organizing the project around core domains like ProjectOrganizer and FeatureManager, you make it easier to navigate and maintain the codebase.
	•	Modularity: Each domain encapsulates its own controllers, models, routes, and views, promoting separation of concerns.
	•	Scalability: Adding new features or domains is straightforward. For example, if you want to add a collaboration feature in the future, you can create a new domain like CollaborationTools/.
	•	Ease of Development: With a clear structure, you and any future collaborators can quickly understand where to add or modify code for specific features.

⸻

Example of Adding a New Feature Domain in the Future

If you decide to implement CollaborationTools for version 1.5:

your_project/
├── CollaborationTools/
    ├── controllers/
    │   └── collaborationController.js
    ├── models/
    │   └── collaborationModel.js
    ├── routes/
    │   └── collaborationRoutes.js
    └── views/
        └── collaborationViews.html

This keeps the new feature encapsulated and consistent with the overall project structure.

⸻

Next Steps
	•	Implement Core Domains: Start coding the UserManagement, ProjectOrganizer, FeatureManager, and AISuggestions domains.
	•	Develop Reusable UI Components: Build the UI components needed for feature cards, drag-and-drop areas, and AI interaction buttons.
	•	Set Up AI Integration: In the AISuggestions domain, set up the OpenAI API integration, ensuring that prompts and responses align with your project’s needs.
	•	Ensure Documentation and Comments: As per your earlier instruction, include detailed comments and specify the file name, purpose, and relevant information at the top of every file. This will aid in understanding and maintaining the codebase.
